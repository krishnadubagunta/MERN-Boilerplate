# MERN-Boilerplate

This is a MERN boilerplate for people who are curious to learn about MERN stack.

Now you can copy the contents of your sever folder and use it in your project.

Client Folder doesn't contain any files. You can use create-react-app to create new react application. everything else is wired up and read to go.

Cheers!
